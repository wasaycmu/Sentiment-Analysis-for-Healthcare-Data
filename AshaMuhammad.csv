"1","Mefleh"," Dr. Mohammad Asha isn’t only a capable doctor but a human who has an extraordinary listening and communication skills, he is one of few doctors that really allows sufficient time to comprehend medical data gathering before jumping to prescribe medicines and that’s one of his success reasons. I’ve been suffering of Blood Pressure for months and couldn’t get it managed even in some European clinics till I met him during my visit to Qatar. I would without any hesitation recommend him for any patient who’s in need for internal medicine consultations/ medications. Thank you Dr. Mohammad for your continuous support and thank you for continuous remote support. I wish you all the best. "
